I'm a second year Ph.D student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech,advised by Prof. Greg Turk. I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. My research interests are physical simulation, character animation, and deep reinforcement learning.

Recently, I'm studying how to train control policies that can drive tools to manipulate deformable bodies.
